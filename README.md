# MSBuild Artifactory Plugin

## Overview
Artifactory brings Continuous Integration to MSBuild, TFS and Visual Studio through the MSBuild Artifactory Plugin. This allows you to capture information about deployed artifacts, resolve Nuget dependencies and environment data associated with MSBuild build runs, and deploy artifacts to Artifactory. In addition, the exhaustive build information captured by Artifactory enables fully traceable builds.
